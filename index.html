                    Yes. 100%. No hidden pro plans, no sign-ups. I made this because I was tired of manually calculating

                    Absolutely. There's an upload button. You can crop your own photos into weird shapes and export them

                    Yes! Since it exports standard CSS `clip-path`, you can animate the polygon values in your own CSS
                    using keyframes or transitions.

                    Because soft shadows are boring and hard edges mimic the precision of vector points. Also, it looks
